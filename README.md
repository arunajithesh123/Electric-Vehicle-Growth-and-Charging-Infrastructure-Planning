# Electric-Vehicle-Growth-and-Charging-Infrastructure-Planning

## Empowering Sustainable Transportation

Analyzing Electric Vehicle growth and optimizing charging infrastructure to pave the way for a greener future.

## About the Project
This project aims to bridge the gap between rapid Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and the infrastructure required to support it. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, we provide actionable insights for optimizing EV charging stations and ensuring an efficient and sustainable EV ecosystem.

Focus Area: Washington State
Timeframe: Analysis covers the period from 2010 to 2024, with predictions extending to 2026.
Outcome: Recommendations for charging station placement and capacity expansion to meet the growing demand.

## Goals
Forecast EV adoption trends for strategic planning.
Analyze county-wise EV-to-charger ratios to identify underserved areas.
Recommend optimal charging station locations to cater to projected EV growth.
Incorporate environmental and logistical factors into planning.

## Data Sources
EV Registration Data: Publicly available datasets from Data.gov and state agencies.
Charging Infrastructure Data: Real-time charging station data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) API.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection

Compiled EV registration data for Washington State, spanning over 1 million records.
Retrieved active charging station data as of 2024 through APIs.
2. Data Preprocessing

Cleaned datasets by handling missing values and outliers.
Standardized date formats and numerical values for consistency.
Engineered new features, such as EV growth rate and charger density.
3. Predictive Modeling

Built machine learning models using ARIMA and SARIMAX to forecast future EV counts.
Validated the models through seasonal decomposition and metrics like AIC and BIC.
4. Analysis

Identified top counties based on EV growth and charging needs: Clark, Snohomish, Kitsap, and Thurston.
Evaluated EV-to-charger ratios and predicted future gaps in infrastructure.
5. Insights and Recommendations

Highlighted priority areas for infrastructure development.
Suggested expansion of chargers near commercial centers, highways, and rural communities.
Recommended faster charging technologies for future readiness.

## Key Insights
EV Growth Trends: The number of EVs has increased exponentially, with predictions indicating continued growth through 2026.
Infrastructure Gaps:
Clark County: Projected EV-to-charger ratio of 260 EVs per charger by 2026.
Snohomish County: 233 EVs per charger.
Kitsap County: 160 EVs per charger.
Optimal Charger Placement:
Near airports and commercial centers to cater to high-demand zones.
Along highway corridors to support long-distance travelers.

## Dashboard Features
Our interactive dashboard provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of EV trends and charging infrastructure needs:

Growth Charts: County-wise EV adoption trends from 2010 to 2026.
Heatmaps: Visual representation of charger density and underserved areas.
Insights Panels: Recommendations for infrastructure expansion.
Prediction Module: Future EV counts and charger requirements.

## Results
High-Growth Counties: Clark, Snohomish, Kitsap, and Thurston show significant EV adoption, necessitating immediate infrastructure planning.
Charger Needs: Clark County alone will require 400+ additional chargers by 2026 to meet demand.
Cost-Effective Planning: Prioritizing high-traffic areas such as highways and commercial zones can maximize charger utility.

## Future Scope
Integrate real-time EV sales data for dynamic forecasting.
Scale the model to a national level for broader insights.
Collaborate with charging companies to implement the recommendations.
Include solar-powered chargers for a sustainable solution.
